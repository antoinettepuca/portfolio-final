		<h1>Cooking and Baking With Antoinette Puca</h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p id="main">Hi! My name is Antoinette Puca and I'm a student at the University of Michigan. One of my hobbies is cooking, where
				I like to explore new recipes to cook on my free time. I became interested in cooking through my relatives, as 
				they've taught me how to cook different Italian foods growing up. When COVID-19 caused us all to stay at home
				in 2020, I started to explore more baking recipes and cuisines outside of Italian food. Going into college, I
				wanted to continue learning to cook new recipes. I have found recipes that take up less time during the day,
				but still are very tasty. To continue exploring my love for cooking, I am a part of the club Kid's Kitchen on campus
				where I help write recipes using simple ingredients for food we donated to families in need. I have taken a few
				cooking classes with my friends and family, and would like to take more in the future.

			<h2>Contents of Website</h2>
			<p>This website is split into different sections: tips, cooking recipes, and baking recipes. Throughout it, you will
				find images and additional advice to describe the recipes. To make this website more inclusive and incorporate
				different ideas, I also asked other college students for recommendations on their favorite foods to make. I have
				been a vegetarian, pescatarian, and diary free for parts of my life, and have included recipes for others in similar
				situations. Additionally, I asked students with certain allergies and other diets for recipes they enjoy as well. 
				Note: I am not a professional chef and still have much to learn, but I hope these recipes and tips help you explore
				the world of cooking and baking!</p>

			<h3 id="tony">Chef Tony Priolo</h3>
			<p>Chef Tony Priolo is a Chicago-based chef that owns a restuarant called Piccolo Sogno. The outdoor view of the restuarant is shown in the second part of
				the flipping image. In his menu, he specializes handling food allergies and being able to serve Italian dishes for different diets. Examples are a peanut free 
				and gluten-free menu. In his restuarant, servers identify all food allergies at the table, figure out where to cook the food safely to avoid cross-contact, and makes sure all
				employees are aware of the allergen. The reason behind his methods is to make everyone feel welcome to eat, safe, and be able to trust the restaurant.
				The restaurant's motto is is "There aren't any food allergies that we can't handle". For more information, please visit
